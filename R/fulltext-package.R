#' Fulltext search and retrieval of scholarly texts.
#' 
#' fulltext is a single interface to as many sources of scholarly texts as possible. In practice,
#' this means only ones that are legally used. We will support sources that require 
#' authentication on a case by case basis - that is, if more than just a few people will use it, 
#' then we can include that source.
#' 
#' We currently include:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item PLOS - Public Library of Science
#'  \item eLife
#'  \item BMC - BioMed Central
#'  \item Crossref
#'  \item Entrez
#'  \item arXiv - ya know, that cool preprint server
#' }
#' 
#' The following are tasks/use cases supported:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item search - \code{ft_search}
#'  \item get texts - \code{ft_get}
#'  \item serialize to different formats - \code{ft_serialize}
#'  \item extract text from pdfs - \code{ft_extract}
#' }
